Personal repository of configuration files

This repository contains my personal configuration files for different
environments (mostly bash and console). It is not supposed to be used directly.
However it might serve as an example for others.

The file structure is supposed to be *installed* using
[linkIt](https://github.com/jakobwesthoff/linkIt).

Needed dependencies can be installed using the `checkout_dependencies.sh`.
